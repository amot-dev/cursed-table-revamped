## About
Ever felt like the curse enchantments were kind of useful? Nobody who finds a "Curse of Binding" piece of armour in the
wild thinks "Yes, that's perfect!" and puts it on. Now, you can get these curses right in the enchanting table (and they
could even be hidden). Now, there actually is a tradeoff to using the table.

But... I couldn't resist adding a bit of customization. So, while by default, curses are available in the table and other
"treasure" enchants aren't, everything is customizable with game rules. Maybe you want Frost Walker available, but think
Swift Sneak is too much? Well, configure to your heart's content!
